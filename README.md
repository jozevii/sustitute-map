Hello "olaf-k-1a"! <br/>
Finally I decided to use an only JavaScript project, I include replace-pattern.js with the problem solved and explained and replace-pattern.test.js with the testing <br/><br/>
List of the 3rd party libraries used:
- Jest (https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started): Used for the testing of the function<br/><br/>
Things not clear and decision:<br/>
- In the email appear that is a JavaScript, HTML, CSS and in the description appear that is a JavaScript exercice. I decided to show only functionality and testing. If you want some design with HTML and CSS you can tell me. <br/>
- What if exist are bidirectional reference? I decided to get the values in order. <br/>
- What if exist an auto reference or a reference to a non existent or empty property? I have decided to omit the auto reference. <br/><br/>
If you have any question or something to say to me you can contact me josevrb98@gmail.com <br/>
I hope to finish the project this weekend. <br/>
Best regards, <br/>
